My brother and I are currently developing a Spotify Statistics tool that analyzes song features to generate data-driven insights for playlist submissions. This tool creates mood-based playlists tailored to individual preferences within Spotify accounts and employs clustering algorithms to group songs with similar characteristics. Our long-term vision includes integrating this tool with the Instagram and YouTube APIs to provide a comprehensive analysis of marketing campaigns across multiple platforms. This holistic approach is designed to help musicians optimize their promotional strategies and enrich the musical journey for everyday users.

Currently developing a Spotify tool that enables artists to analyze song features, create mood-based playlists, and gain insights to enhance audience reach and visibility:

Here is more information:

• Conducted a data analysis initiative using Spotify’s API to examine the Rolling Stones catalog, applying univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis alongside PCA and K-Means clustering to categorize song features. This approach identified potential cohorts for enhancing recommendation algorithms and artist visibility, generating strategic playlist placement recommendations that could aid artists in expanding their audience.

• Initiated an expansion of the project to develop a user-friendly web interface using Python and Streamlit, enabling artists to interactively analyze their song features such as energy, valence, and danceability, and receive actionable insights for increasing their reach on Spotify. Key features include:

- Song Analysis Tool: Offers detailed, interactive visualizations using Plotly, helping users and artists understand audio characteristics and patterns across tracks.
- Mood-Based Playlist Creation: Allows users to manage playlists directly on Spotify with functionalities to add and remove tracks and generate playlists tailored to specific emotional states, such as "Happy," "Energetic," and "Relaxed." This feature uses statis-based rules along with PCA and K-Means clustering to group liked songs into distinct cohorts, creating personalized playlists for a more customized listening experience.
- Recommendation Engine: Provides personalized song suggestions based on user input and listening history, leveraging Spotify's recommendation algorithms to enhance music discovery.

If you want to test the app, I will need to whitelist your email. Let me know!

• Future Prospects:

- Expanding the interface with the OpenAI API to generate customized pitches for artists to submit to Spotify’s editorial team, creating personalized proposals based on song features to improve chances of playlist placement and boost artist visibility.
- Implementing dynamic exploratory data analysis for artists’ songs to identify correlations between song features and popularity, uncovering potential song cohorts and generating strategic recommendations for Spotify playlist placements.
