My brother and I are currently developing a Spotify Statistics tool that analyzes song features to generate data-driven insights for playlist submissions. This tool creates mood-based playlists tailored to individual preferences within Spotify accounts and employs clustering algorithms to group songs with similar characteristics. Our long-term vision includes integrating this tool with the Instagram and YouTube APIs to provide a comprehensive analysis of marketing campaigns across multiple platforms. This holistic approach is designed to help musicians optimize their promotional strategies and enrich the musical journey for everyday users.
